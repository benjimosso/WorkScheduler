# WorkScheduler
# DESCRIPTION
### In this assigment I created a WorkSchedule Application. 
### This is some of the requirements:
    - The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
    - I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. 
    - each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
    - I can enter an event. 
    - The text for that event is saved in local storage.
    - The saved events persist when I refresh the page.
